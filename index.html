            <h2>About Jhon Mayday</h2>
            <p>Jhon Mayday is an up and coming Peruvian artist who aims to one day be recognized for his creative innovations and help touch many people's hearts with his music. His music is defined by a mix of cultures coming from, and not limited to, rap, reggaeton, and the 80's sound, building up a melodic approach to different sounds. His catchphrase of “Real Risk Real Gain”, defines who he is and relates to the many risk-takers in the world. To him, it defines his immigrant standpoint, status, and past experiences he's been through, but differs with each person.</p>
